*All the stuff* 
*I do*  
*as I go through*  
*the fast.ai MOOC*  

- The first project Civic Vs Corolla is a (succesful) attempt to classify different pictures of a civic or a corolla
using restNet34. Now you might ask why did I choose to classify pictures of 2 different cars and not 100? 
This was my second attempt at an image classfication problem and the first one failed (because of me using a not-so-great 
dataset I built). So I wanted to start small (and hopefully expand it into something cool)

I aim to addmore experiments here from time to time, as I make my way through the MOOC. 

This is my high-level understanding of how things work or at least the most up-to-date flow chart representation of it

![why flowcharts? because they are awesome, and don't you wish everything was simply described by a flowchart](https://github.com/kshitijng/fast-ai-experiments/blob/master/ELI18-Neural%20Networks%20to%20myself.png)


Sidenote: Jupyter notebooks are amazing. As someone who likes to forget why I did something, its amazing to come back and just read the added context they provide as a notebook especially when I am trying to learn my way through something for the first time.
